Project05 Analysis of Algoirthms @UNAM Facultad de Ciencias
====================

This was a project for my Analysis of Algorithms course at UNAM, i rescued it from the bin. It´s not complete since i lost the final
version which actually i was evaluated.

This project was about implementing Dijkstra´s shortest path algorithm in an graph represented as an XML. It can be tested with Apache Ant.
